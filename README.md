Build a system for automatically classifying song lyrics comments by era:

- Basic text processing, tokenizing input and converting it into a bag-of-words representation
- Build a machine learning classifier based on the generative model, using Naive Bayes
- Evaluate your classifiers and examine what they have learned
- Build a machine learning classifier based on the discriminative model, using Perceptron
- Build a logistic regression classifier using PyTorch
- Implement techniques to improve the classifier
